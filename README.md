### Why ?

To switch between selection mode in Blender you have to do "ctrl+tab then key" or "move mouse + clic + reposition mouse". These actions are heavily repeated during modelling and deserves dedicated keys. Guess what ? these are available !

### Description:

This addon map hotkeys for edit mode only on the top row numbers keys.
(incompatible with "emulate numpad" option)

3Dview:
  * 1 - Vertex 
  * 2 - Edge 
  * 3 - Face
  * 4 - Limit selection to visible (occlude geometry)

UVeditor:
  * 1 - Vertex
  * 2 - Edge
  * 3 - Face
  * 4 - Island

Now you don't have to hit ctrl+tab before ! Just hit one key and speed-up your workflow.

Thanks to CoDEmanX and Atom for their helps (intended or not ^^)
